# Project Motivation

## Background on Dialysis and Proposition 29

Dialysis is a lifesaving treatment that removes waste from blood, acting as an artificial kidney for those with chronic kidney disease. In recent years, California has seen multiple attempts to increase regulations on dialysis clinics through ballot initiatives:

- Proposition 8 in 2018
- Proposition 23 in 2020
- Proposition 29 in 2022

Proposition 29, which failed to pass, aimed to establish increased regulations for both staffing and operations for the roughly 600 dialysis clinics in California, an estimated $3.5 billion industry. A key provision of the proposition required the presence of a physician or licensed practitioner during all treatment hours, potentially increasing each clinic's costs by several hundred thousand dollars annually.

## Debate Surrounding Dialysis Regulations

- **Proponents** argue that increased regulations improve patient safety and quality of care.
- **Opponents** contend that the increase in healthcare costs is unwarranted and would limit care coverage by overwhelming clinics with costs and potentially forcing them to close.

## Project Scope and Significance

Our project explores trends in:

1. Dialysis clinic access
2. Quality of care
3. Ballot results in California

Using publicly available data from:

- Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
- Aggregated election results from California's Secretary of State

We analyze associations between dialysis care and voting behaviors, specifically those related to recent statewide ballot initiatives designed to regulate California's multibillion-dollar dialysis industry.

## Relevance and Novelty

- This project uses a novel approach to study an area of public interest relevant not just to California but the entire country.
- To our knowledge, this is the first project of its kind to explore the possible association between voting patterns and the quality of dialysis care received.
- The majority of dialysis treatments in California are covered by Medicare, making the Medicare and Medicaid datasets particularly relevant to our analysis.

## Broader Context

Investigative reporters, patient advocacy groups, and labor organizations have spent significant resources over the past decade to raise public awareness of the dialysis industry and its need for regulation. Our project contributes to this ongoing discussion by providing data-driven insights into the relationship between dialysis care quality and voting behavior.
