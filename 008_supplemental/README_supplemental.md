# Supplemental Files

This folder contains files no longer apart of our main analysis for various reasons. 

Some reasons include:
    - Related dataset no longer being used in this analysis (ballor measure information aggregated on different geo levels, census and demographic information, and supplemental demo information on residents of california)
    - Misc. Data exploration across the datasets (importing and cleaning aformentioned datasets, data preparation, visualization etc.)
    - Restructuring old datasets or formats of data not used in the data in preparation for analysis or visuals

While no longer apart of our report and submission for this course, we belive that they may be useful in future iterations of this project and may be built upon in subsequent courses that we may take to answer questions that arose as we explored this topic.
