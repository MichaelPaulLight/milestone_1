# Project Motivation

## Background on Dialysis and Proposition 29

Dialysis is a lifesaving treatment that removes waste from blood, acting as an artificial kidney for those with chronic kidney disease. In recent years, California has seen multiple attempts to increase regulations on dialysis facilities through ballot initiatives:

-   Proposition 8 in 2018
-   Proposition 23 in 2020
-   Proposition 29 in 2022

Proposition 29, which failed to pass, aimed to establish increased regulations for both staffing and operations for the roughly 600 dialysis facilities in California, an estimated \$3.5 billion industry. A key provision of the proposition required the presence of a physician or licensed practitioner during all treatment hours, potentially increasing each facility's costs by several hundred thousand dollars annually.

## Debate Surrounding Dialysis Regulations

-   **Proponents** argue that increased regulations improve patient safety and quality of care.
-   **Opponents** contend that the increase in healthcare costs is unwarranted and would limit care coverage by overwhelming facilities with costs and potentially [forcing them to close](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-08/2022-california-election-prop-29-vote-dialysis-clinic-results).

## Project Scope and Significance

Our project explores trends in:

1.  Dialysis facility access
2.  Quality of care
3.  Ballot results in California

Using publicly available data from:

-   Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
-   Aggregated election results from California's Secretary of State

We analyze associations between dialysis care and voting behaviors, specifically those related to recent statewide ballot initiatives designed to regulate California's multibillion-dollar dialysis industry.

## Relevance and Novelty

-   This project uses a novel approach to study an area of public interest relevant not just to California but the entire country.
-   To our knowledge, this is the first project of its kind to explore the possible association between voting patterns and the quality of dialysis care received.
-   The majority of dialysis treatments in California [are covered by Medicare](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=29&year=2022), making the Medicare and Medicaid datasets particularly relevant to our analysis.

## Broader Context

Investigative reporters, patient advocacy groups, and labor organizations have spent significant resources over the past decade to raise public awareness of the dialysis industry and its need for regulation. Our project contributes to this ongoing discussion by providing data-driven insights into the relationship between dialysis care quality and voting behavior.

# Project Research Questions

Our research questions are divided into two categories: primary and secondary. The primary question serves as the main focus of our analysis, while secondary questions provide additional insights through further investigation of the data.

## Primary Research Question

**Is the quality of care of dialysis facilities correlated with voting in favor of or against dialysis industry regulation?**

### Key Assumptions

1.  The relationship between Quality of Care and Voting Behavior is not confounded.
2.  A vote in favor of any of the three propositions (Prop 8 in 2018, Prop 23 in 2020, Prop 29 in 2022) can be interpreted as support for dialysis industry regulation.

### Quality of Care Metrics

To test this relationship under the outlined assumptions, we approximate the quality of care using the following metrics:

-   Five-star rating
-   Patient experience rating
-   Facility mortality rate
-   Number of available dialysis stations
-   Staff rating
-   Hospital readmission categorization (Worse than Expected, As Expected, Better than Expected)
-   Profit/non-profit designation
-   Parent company affiliation/independence

### Facility Categorization

Observations of Quality of Care metrics in our data are categorized by:

-   Year
-   County
-   City
-   Profit/Non-profit designation
-   Parent company affiliation/independence

## Secondary Research Questions

1.  What is the geographic coverage of dialysis facilities in California?
2.  Is there any correlation between organizational structure (chain-owned, profit vs. non-profit) and the quality of care?
3.  Is there any association between the parent company of dialysis facilities and the quality of care?

# Data Manipulation Methods

Our workflow was broken down into five stages:

1.  Data Collection
2.  Data Preparation
3.  Database Management
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis
5.  Statistical Analysis

## Data Collection and Preparation

#### Organization and Import

-   Dataset structure: .zip files (one per year), containing multiple Excel files
-   Focus: Excel files relevant to facility general information, ratings, and patient survey results
-   Import result: Two separate parquet files at the facility level
    1.  Patient survey responses
    2.  Facility ratings and measurements

#### Challenges and Solutions

1.  Inconsistent File Naming Conventions
    -   Issue: 2021 files named differently (e.g., patient survey data file named '59mq-zhts')
    -   Solution: Created a list of exact file names for selection, rather than using pattern matching
2.  Missing Data
    -   Expected missing data: Survey non-responses
    -   Unexpected missing data: Administrative errors (e.g., missing columns in recent ICHPS raw data files)
    -   Solution for specific cases: Simple imputation during analysis (e.g., substituting 2018 'nan' values with 2019 values at the facility level)

# Analysis and Insights

This project employed a Bayesian approach to investigate the relationship between dialysis facility quality metrics and voting patterns on dialysis-related propositions in California.

To maximize the granularity of our analysis, we chose to focus on city-level data, which provided more detailed vote counts compared to assembly district level data. We encoded voting outcomes as the percentage of "Yes" votes in favor of the propositions, allowing for a nuanced examination of support for dialysis industry regulation across different localities.

Given the limitations and challenges detailed below, we were able to gain some insights into our primary research question: **Is the quality of care of dialysis facilities correlated with voting in favor of or against dialysis industry regulation?**

We were also able to use visual analysis of the un-modeled data to gain some insights into the geographic coverage of dialysis facilities in the state.

## Analysis Steps

### Data Preparation

Before modeling and analysis, we underwent several data preparation steps. These were kept until the analysis stage in the interest of transparency. Steps taken included 

1. Imputing missing 2018 values using 2019 data for select variables.
3. Converting datatypes.
4. Calculating vote percentages in favor of regulation for each facility's city.
5. Filtering data to include years 2018, 2020, and 2022.
6. Aggregating data at the facility level, summarizing vote outcomes and facility characteristics.
7. Removing rows with missing values to perform a complete case analysis.

### Model Construction

We constructed a Bayesian multilevel model using the brms package in R. This model allowed us to account for the hierarchical nature of our data (facilities nested within cities and counties) while examining the relationship between facility quality metrics and voting outcomes.

### Posterior Predictive Checks:

We performed posterior predictive checks to assess model fit and explore relationships between key variables and voting outcomes.

## Insights

### Staff Rating Impact:

Our analysis revealed a negative relationship between staff ratings and the percentage of votes in favor of dialysis regulation. This suggests that areas with lower-rated dialysis facility staff were more likely to support increased regulation. The effect of staff rating varied across counties, with some counties showing stronger negative relationships than others.

![Effect of Staff Rating on Predicted Vote Percentage](../007_visualizations/staff_rating_effect.png){width=90%}

### Mortality Rate Influence:

We found a positive relationship between facility mortality rates and support for regulation. As mortality rates increased, the predicted vote percentage in favor of regulation also increased. This suggests that voters in areas with higher mortality rates at dialysis facilities were more likely to support increased oversight.

### Patient Experience Rating:

Interestingly, our analysis showed a positive relationship between patient experience ratings and support for regulation. This counterintuitive finding suggests that even in areas where patients report better experiences, there is still support for increased regulation.

### Five Star Rating and Stations per Facility: 
The associations of these metrics on voting behavior were weaker compared to staff ratings, mortality rates, and patient experience ratings. The estimated effects suggested by the posterior predictive checks were clustered around zero.

### Chain Organization Effects:

The posterior predictive check for chain organizations showed varying levels of support for regulation across different dialysis chains, indicating that organizational factors may play a role in shaping public opinion or voting behavior.

### Facility Size Considerations:

The number of dialysis stations (a proxy for facility size) showed a slight positive relationship with voting in favor of regulation, suggesting that areas with larger facilities might be more supportive of increased oversight.

## Challenges and Limitations

Our analysis faced several key constraints that warrant consideration:

1. **Data Granularity**: Facility-level quality metrics were paired with city/county-level voting data, potentially obscuring finer-grained relationships and risking ecological fallacy.

2. **Temporal Dynamics**: The model assumes immediate effects of facility metrics on voting behavior, potentially overlooking lagged effects or longer-term trends.

3. **Confounding Factors**: Unmeasured variables such as socioeconomic factors, political leanings, or media coverage may influence both facility quality and voting patterns.

4. **Causal Interpretation**: While our model reveals associations, causal relationships cannot be inferred without further quasi-experimental or instrumental variable approaches.

5. **Measurement and Data Quality**: Quality metrics and aggregated voting data may not perfectly capture true care quality or individual voting behavior, introducing potential measurement error.

6. **External Validity**: Findings from California may not generalize to regions with different political, demographic, or healthcare landscapes.

These limitations highlight opportunities for future research, including more granular data collection, time-series analyses, incorporation of additional variables, and replication studies in diverse contexts.
